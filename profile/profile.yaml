summary:  I am a software developer with a strong foundation in backend engineering, data analytics, and fintech systems. My professional experience at Moneris allowed me to design and deploy RESTful APIs, optimize Spring Boot microservices, and enhance Kafka based pipelines that supported thousands of daily client transactions. I have built efficient SQL workflows, automated testing environments, and collaborated across Agile teams to maintain reliable CI and CD deployments. Alongside industry experience, I have developed a deep understanding of modern software ecosystems through my Computer Science degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, where I was able to apply my critical and architectural reasoning skills through advanced coursework and hands on projects in machine learning, system design, and data visualization. I value teamwork, continuous learning, and thoughtful engineering. I am driven by curiosity. Whether exploring scalable software infrastructure, improving developer workflows, or mentoring peers, I aim to keep growing into a well rounded developer who builds technology that simplifies systems and delivers measurable impact.

    description: Grep App - Implemented a simplified version of the Unix grep command in Java. The application recursively searches a directory, reads each file line-by-line, applies a user-defined regex pattern, and writes all matching lines to an output file. The app uses several core software engineering concepts including Java OOP design and I/O, regular expressions, and Stream APIs."
